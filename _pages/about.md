It turns out that hosting your own website is very easy to do, and there are tons of templates out there to help you get started. I'm using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which is a Jekyll-based template that's very user friendly. You can fork [the repository](https://github.com/academicpages)to your own [Github page](https://github.com) and start building your personal and academic website right away. 

Okay, now about me.

Woot!
