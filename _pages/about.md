# Making your own academic website is easy and free

## Using Github Pages to make your own free website.

It turns out that hosting your own website is very easy to do, and there are tons of templates out there to help you get started. I'm using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which is a Jekyll-based template that's very user friendly. You can fork [the repository](https://github.com/academicpages)to your own [Github page](https://github.com) and start building your personal and academic website right away.
